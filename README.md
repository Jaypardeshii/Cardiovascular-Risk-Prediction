# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
## Problem Statement:
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
## Introduction:
A lot of people suffer from various diseases. Some diseases like Sugar, High BP, Diabetes etc have become very common in our society. On an average around 30% youth in each state has its BMI greater than 25, which is considered as obsess. This small things which sometimes aren’t considered much as threat lay foundation to major heart diseases in future. So, our model is aim to classify people goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease which is based on various behavioural trait, medical history etc.
## Overall Summary
* Predicting the risk of coronary heart disease is critical for reducing fatalities caused by this illness. We can avert deaths by taking the required medications and precautions if we can foresee the danger of this sickness ahead of time.
* It is critical that the model we develop has a high recall score. It is OK if the model incorrectly identifies a healthy patient as a high risk patient because it will not result in death, but if a high risk patient is incorrectly labelled as healthy, it may result in fatality.
* We were able to create a model with a recall of just 0.77 because of limitated data available and limited computational power availabe.
* A recall score of 0.77 indicates that out of 100 individuals with the illness, our model will be able to classify only 77 as high risk patients, while the remaining 33 will be misclassified.
* Future developments must include a strategy to improve the model recall score, enabling us to save even more lives from this disease. This includes involving more people in the study, and include people with different medical history, etc build an application with better recall score.
